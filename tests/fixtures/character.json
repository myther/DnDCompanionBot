To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span>burning hands</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span>burning hands</span> using either slot.</p>\r\n<h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>\r\n<p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>",

You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric&mdash;performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.</p>\r\n<p>Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. The <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/phb/appendix-b-gods-of-the-multiverse\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gods of the Multiverse</a> section contains a sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong>&nbsp;Insight, Religion</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Languages:</strong> Two of your choice</dt>\r\n<dt><strong>Equipment:</strong> A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp</dt>\r\n</dl>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>FEATURE: SHELTER OF THE FAITHFUL</strong></p>\r\n<p>As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity.

Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home.

If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span>you put it on).</span></p>\r\n<p>As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart &mdash; in a chaste sort of devotion.

These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. Your retainers are commoners who can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"line character margintop20 marginbottom20\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<h5>Suggested Characteristics</h5>\r\n<p>Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing.
